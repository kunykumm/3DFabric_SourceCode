# 3DFabric: SourceCode

This application serves to generate digital structures resembling textiles. It was developed as a part of my bachelor thesis about 3D printed fabric. 
The implementation takes into consideration the chosen 3D printer (Fortus 250mc) which uses ABSplus-P430 as a material. All generated meshes were successfully 
printed using this printer.
